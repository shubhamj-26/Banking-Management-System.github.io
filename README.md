### Banking Management System

The Banking Management System is a comprehensive backend system that embraces Microservices architecture to efficiently manage various banking functions. This system covers essential aspects such as account details, card management, loan processing, insurance management, and configuration settings. Each of these functions is handled by a dedicated microservice, providing a scalable and flexible solution.

## 🏁 Microservices Architecture <a name="microservices_architecture"></a>

The Banking Management System is designed with a Microservices architecture, allowing for the following advantages:

- **Scalability:** Each banking function is encapsulated within a microservice, enabling independent scaling based on demand.
  
- **Flexibility:** Microservices offer flexibility in technology stack, development, and deployment, allowing for rapid updates and modifications.

- **Isolation:** Isolating functions into microservices ensures fault tolerance and prevents the failure of one service from affecting others.
